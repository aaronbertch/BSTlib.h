BSTlib.h
========

This is a basic binary search tree library created to help students learn how to code different functions in a BST. When I was taking my CS1 course I have a lot of issues with finding code that worked was difficult to find or inconsistent. It includes insertion, deletion, searching, and some extra functions ( array to tree, summing nodes, basic traversal functions).  If you would like to add functions or modify code, feel free to do so.
